# Leep years

Write a program in Java to find out whether the year entered by the user is a leap year.

What is Leap Year?

A leap year is a year with 366 days instead of 365 in the Gregorian calendar. This extra day (leap day) is obtained by adding February 29 to February, which normally has 28 days.

How to Calculate Leap Year?

As a general rule, leap years are years that are multiples of 4:

Such as 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024.
Among the years that are multiples of 100, only those that are divisible by 400 without remainder are leap years:

For example, the years 1200, 1600, and 2000 are leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years.
The reason why only those that are divisible by 400 are considered leap years is to eliminate the error caused by the fact that an astronomical year is approximately 365.242 days, not 365.25 days.
